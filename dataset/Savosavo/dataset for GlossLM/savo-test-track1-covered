\g 
\l Go on, right?

\t lole
\g 
\l That's it?

\t ailo rongorongoe lo lotu lova ba ave gnomata saraghu zu supu mapagha na elakati pale buka la padali zeze lolomi tai palea zaqigha pai kia lotu lova tokoghu at savo la alalia
\g 
\l This story is about the arrival of the church here, and many people will have read it in books and know a few paragraphs, whereabout on savo the church arrived.

\t zu aveva eneli lau ba sua rongorongoe kagnika negha sua pale lo lo buka la
\g 
\l But the story that we were told is very different from the one in the books.

\t sere sogha ze silelitu lo bukagha la
\g 
\l In the books the white people wrote.

\t telo te lo aveva enelitu lo na te ave kukuagha ave kulaghagha ave mama maugha zemata ave eneli lau ba sue tei sua
\g 
\l And then the one we heard from our grandparents, our uncles, [and] our parents, the one we were told is this.

\t lo lo patere neu lo magnigha la paba latu alua telo ba fiji memere sodu ma taemu la ota palei
\g 
\l In 1898 father bouillon started from somewhere at his home and came to fiji and stayed there a bit.

\t tulola ota alua telo lova te ba ruasura bazu
\g 
\l Then he started there and came to ruasura [a small island off guadalcanal] in february.

\t lova doi laughu pai lo lo latu ota doi loghoalighu lo lova rongorongogha na otatu
\g 
\l If he bought land [i.e. for the mission] / how it came that he owned land there, that it is a different story.

\t zu ave na lo lo maitei sua ba zabaghulo te lotu na ata savo la palai teighu la te ailo rongorongo na kozizu
\g 
\l But we, how the church came here, that is what this story is about.

\t tulola lo a ruasura tokoa telo patu
\g 
\l And he arrived at ruasura and stayed.

\t lova lova ota zaka palea sua palea katekistogha lo fijigha kuava katekistoghaze te savulizu laka ruasura baghu
\g 
\l In december 1898, a few catechists that he was staying with, fijians, they said that nine catechists came with bishop bidle to ruasura.

\t teze ota patu ailo ai savulitu lo lo manga la edo fiji sua katekistolo to otatu seloa teto tulaghi tavatughue
\g 
\l And then while they were staying there, at this time that i mentioned, in december 1898 two catechists from fiji sailed from there across to tulaghi.

\t teto tulaghi bo sara ze oma ota ghoi matatizu
\g 
\l When they arrived at tulaghi, they also didn't want them there.

\t otatu to te seloa teto ata neti lalavela ba tokoghue lo
\g 
\l From there they sailed on and arrived down here at lalavela.

\t aito edo fiji sua mapalo tona lo mario zu lo costatino tova nini na
\g 
\l These two fijians, mario and costantino were their names.

\t te tova ota ba saratu lo mangagha la utukoba na te ailo magnigha leghe sala palei pozogho lo lo ma magnigha lova dui mapae lo na
\g 
\l And when they arrived there, in those days, utukoba was looking after this village, he was the village's big man.

\t telo memere lia sua te a ghanaghana na a zabai lo ivaghu la mananae lo tadagha ze raghevitighu aito edo katekistolo
\g 
\l And on that day something a bit different happened. the men should have run to them, these two catechists.

\t zu lova liaghu ai savulighue lo tada mapagha lo titina mapagha lo lo dui mapagha na tamalutizu
\g 
\l But the difference i mean was that the old men, the grown-up men [and] the elders were afraid of them.

\t tulola zeva te vaitulamighue lo lo kabu daki mapagha
\g 
\l And so they ordered that group of old women:

\t bolu me na zeme sighoi bo qelelu
\g 
\l "you go and check, go and have a look.

\t sokilu
\g 
\l Peep.

\t lo apoi to rongoto te lau bai
\g 
\l What is it they brought.

\t zeme mane ba ave gnaka savuli tei
\g 
\l Then you come and tell us." [they] said.

\t tulola zeva te boghue lo na ailo kabu daki mapagha na
\g 
\l And so they went, this group of old women.

\t lo kabu voghae tave la pono soghae lo ivaghu la oma lotu soghae
\g 
\l They were a group of heathens, they didn't know anything [about this religion], they were not christians.

\t oma ailo lo maiva qod kongali lau ba soghae ze na
\g 
\l They were not worshipping this our god.

\t bona momou majaligha lo teitu lo vatae ze pala sua
\g 
\l They only [worshipped] ghosts and heathen gods, things like that.

\t koi buka kona pale koi sodokeke kona otatu
\g 
\l Buka was inside [the group], sodokeke was there.

\t koi sanavele kona ota koi koje kona otatu
\g 
\l Sanavele was there, koje was there.

\t saemata kona ota koi sabiri kona pale lo daki mapaghae ze na lo ivaghu la
\g 
\l Saemata was there, sabiri was inside, they were the old women that day.

\t supurongo na otatu lo zeva ghanamia teze rongorongomi savumitu lo zepo te savumitu
\g 
\l Many were there, those that they remembered and told the story about i am telling.

\t ze na bua zeze bo tegheghue lo na ailo lo mario zu lo kosi tova ota lalavela tokoghu
\g 
\l They went and they saw this mario and costantino as they arrived there at lalavela.

\t kiaze elakati bo toko kiato elakati lo rosario to raghili suali tai zeto tova zaughali lametighue lo na to kakau la tei zaughali rosario
\g 
\l And when they [the old women] arrived, they pulled out the rosary and showed it to them, showed it like this with their hand, the rosary.

\t elakati ailo zazagha daki mapagha na leghe zeze elamoka koi lo maghanie tei tai
\g 
\l This group of old women saw it and thought it was decorations.

\t levolevo la ite sue omaze mapamapa lolomizu apoize kati ata sogha na savuli kia to na eneli lolomi tai
\g 
\l On communication, it is true, they didn't understand each other, what would the local people say that those two would understand.

\t apoi kati to na savuli kia ata sogha na eneli lolomi tai
\g 
\l What would they say, that the local people would understand.

\t teighu la lo kakau la te ze ghoi lo padapada zaughali sua
\g 
\l Because of that they only used their hands to make signs.

\t pozogho dologhu pai kia zughuzughu abagnighu pai kia maitei sua keva kapisie kakau pono laz te lo la levolevozu lo ivaghu la
\g 
\l Basically, peace, or otherwise disagreement and arguments, or otherwise anything, only with the hands did they talk about it on that day.

\t zu ze na ailo rosario leghea teze elamoka lo kekeve tei lo maghanie tei
\g 
\l And they saw this rosary and they thought it was a necklace, decoration.

\t teighu laze te ghasea teze te bua teze bo tititirotia teze tabotabotia teze rajetia teze ite tei soghae lo ailo ai savulitu lo zazagha daki mapagha
\g 
\l Because of that they were happy and they went and examined them and touched them and stroked them, and did like this, this group of old women i am talking about.

\t tulola zeva te raghe liazaghue lo na
\g 
\l And then they ran back.

\t raghe liaza teze ba lo dui mapa laka savulizu ailo lo utukoba
\g 
\l [they] ran back and they told the big man, this utukoba.

\t tulola lova m lo vatae tei

\l "ae, but if that is so, go and call them so that they come." [he] said.

\l Their quarters, we would point to it and say hereabout were their quarters.

\t zeva lo pala laju tulola lova te ighia laqa sua mapagha memere madomadoke sua mapagha tote vilimighue lo na pale ailo magnigha la
